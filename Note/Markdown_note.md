# My Fabulous Recipe
This recipe for **cereal and milk** has been passed down my family for months.
## Ingredients
- Gereal (you can find [cool cereals](www.example.com/coolcereals) here)
- Milk

## Directions
If I were writing these out as _code_, it might look something like this:
```
if bowl is empty:
  add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
  add milk```
