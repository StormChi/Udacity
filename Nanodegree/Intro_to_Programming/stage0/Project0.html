    <h4>Part I</h4>
    <p>"President Jiang, what do you think of Mr. Tung's re-election?" Cheung asked.</p>
    <p>"It's good!" Jiang answered in Cantonese.<p>
    <p>"The central government also support him?" Cheung asked.</p>
    <p>"Of course." Jiang answered happily.</p>
    <p>"Does it mean he has been appointed because it is still too early to state?"</p>
    <b>Part II</b>
    <p>"I don't mean that, every step we should follow the Hong Kong Basic Law, and Election Law. You just asked me that, I actually could just answer you that 'I cannot tell you that.' But you will not satisfied about this, then what should I do? What I said has no means about appointed or some other undercover election. You just asked me about 'support', so I said 'Of course'. I can assure you that. I think you, and the Hong Kong press, should learn more. You are fully aware the Western theories, but after all, you are <strong><em>TOO YOUNG</em></strong>, understand?! I told you I am a veteran on this, is there any Western country that I have never been to?! You must understand that Mike Wallace from the USA has much more experience than you! We talked in a friendly atmosphere! The media professionals should improve your knowledge. Understand?! (Cantonese) I feel stressed out for you people, seriously. Anyway you have one advantage, wherever and whatever something happened, you run to there much faster than Western reporters. But your questions are <strong style="color: blue"><em>TOO SIMPLE, SOMETIMES NAÏVE!</em></strong>

    Understand?! I apologized, today I talked to you as <strong style="color: red"><em>an old experienced man<em></strong><img src="http://bbs.hasi.wang/content/uploadfile/201507/61701438189941.jpg" alt="as a elder" width=50px>, not the President; I am not a press professional either. However I have seen a lot. It is necessary to teach you some life experiences." Jiang roared, with rage.</p>
    <h4>Part III</h4>
    <p><strong><em>"There is a famous old Chinese saying: 'Shut the f*ck up and make f*cking money.' </em></strong>I think this one is the best! But I also considered your enthusiasm, I cannot say nothing. If any misunderstand or bias appeared on your reporting, you have to take the responsibility. I didn't say 'appointed', I have no means of it. But you insisted to ask me do I support Mr. Tung, I have no doubt on this as well. He is the Chief Executive in office, how could I do not support him?" Jiang continued, still with anger.</p>

    <p>"What about re-election..." Cheung whispered.
    "We need to obey the Hong Kong Basic Law, am I correct? And, in addition, our (central government) decision is vital as well! Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is belongs to the Central Government of People's Republic of China. Of course I could make a statement. Understand? You guys, do not attempt to make a breaking news about 'It is appointed now' and judge me with misleading point. <em style="color: green">YOU PEOPLE ARE NAÏVE! I AM ANGRY!"</em><img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/10349783_812367962194811_1221365023_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTA1ODcxNjI2ODA1MTI2OTIwOQ%3D%3D.2" alt="jimo" width=50px></p>
    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>After this incident, and the power of Internet, social media, "Too young too simple, sometimes naïve" has widely spreaded to the Chinese society. But, this is irony that only few people knows the origin of this saying.</p>
