            <p>"President Jiang, what do you think of Mr. Tung's re-election?" Cheung asked.
            </p>
            <p>"It's good!" Jiang answered in Cantonese.
            </p>
            <p>"The central government also support him?" Cheung asked.   
            </p>
            <p>"Of course." Jiang answered happily. 
            </p>
            <p>"Does it mean he has been appointed because it is still too early to state?"  
            </p>
            <p>"I don't mean that, every step we should follow the Hong Kong Basic Law, and Election Law. You just asked me that, I actually could just answer you that 'I cannot tell you that.' But you will not satisfied about this, then what should I do? What I said has no means about appointed or some other undercover election. You just asked me about 'support', so I said 'Of course'. I can assure you that. I think you, and the Hong Kong press, should learn more. You are fully aware the Western theories, but after all, you are <strong><em>TOO YOUNG</em></strong>, understand?!
            </p>
            <p> I told you I am a veteran on this, is there any Western country that I have never been to?! You must understand that Mike Wallace from the USA has much more experience than you! We talked in a friendly atmosphere! The media professionals should improve your knowledge. Understand?! (Cantonese) I feel stressed out for you people, seriously. Anyway you have one advantage, wherever and whatever something happened, you run to there much faster than Western reporters. But your questions are <strong><em>TOO SIMPLE, SOMETIMES NAÏVE!</em></strong>

            Understand?! I apologized, today I talked to you as <strong><em>an old experienced man</em></strong><img src="http://bbs.hasi.wang/content/uploadfile/201507/61701438189941.jpg" alt="as a elder" class="tiny_picture">, not the President; I am not a press professional either. However I have seen a lot. It is necessary to teach you some life experiences." Jiang roared, with rage.

           <p> There is always a feeling that the culture of us is becoming less decent. If you pursue something elegant, people will mock at you. In Chinese, a taboo word zhuangbi is dedicated to the description of this. It is upset the elegant culture is put into an embarrassing position: on one hand, it is always promoted due to some “political correctness”; on the other hand, people are keeping a distance from it.
           </p>
           <p>Embracing low culture is becoming the “requirement” of commercial success. Web editors are trying their best to seek the latest “popular” words and use it: from the ever-popular word “diaosi”, to the recent “socialism” meme (popular but poorly written sentences with some words replaced by “socialism”). Bored of these, we need to find something not so low. And moha accidentally indicated a way for us.

            <p>Indeed，more and more people begin to make fun of Mr Jiang ,especially college students.The beginning is a video,you can search "Rare Footage of Former China Leader Jiang Zemin Freak Out (With English Subs!)" in YouTube.We can hear some typical joke points,such as too young too simple sometimes naive.
            </p>
            <p>critical thinking and skeptical thinking,independent personality is being established gradually,especially young people with high education.
               People start to talk and discuss many aspects of issues in public or private,which is really good, but in China ,talking politics has many obstacles and taboos which hinder development of China.
